```
npm install https://github.com/M4LE5/node-red-contrib-bunq/tarball/master
or
npm install git+https://github.com/M4LE5/node-red-contrib-bunq.git

1. Put a Sandbox node (Action: Create Sandbox User) on a tab and create a new config connection. -> Deploy and run
2. Copy the API-key into the newly created config connection.
3. Put an Installation node on the tab. -> Deploy and run
4. Copy the given Token into config connection (as Installation token).
5. Put a Device node on the tab and configure the properties as you like. -> Deploy and run

### Production Mode
If you need to create the installation and add device then you need to perform these steps:

1. Put a Installation node on a tab and create a new config connection.
2. Copy the API-key into the newly created config connection. -> Deploy and run
3. Copy the given Token into config connection (as Installation token).
5. Put a Device node on the tab and configure the properties as you like. -> Deploy and run

If you got a private/public key .pem-file, you can point to this file on config node in the input field "Private Key Client".

## FAQ

- Why my payment (bunq Monetary Node) is always only saved as draft?
    - Because you handle with your own money by using an open API. If something happen wrong, you can get lost your money!
